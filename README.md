facebook Example - wp7 only

This is just an example project about logging into facebook using an mvvmcross pattern on wp7...

Plenty of other patterns are available...

And this app is clearly not 100% finished - it's just for demo :)

Libraries like WriteableBitmapEx, Newtonsoft Json, Facebook CSharp and Mvvmcross are included as binaries subject to their licenses.
